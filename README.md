# openadr-3-client
Client library for OpenADR 3


Plan

* Implement a Node.js/TypeScript client API
* Use the openadr-3-ts-types project
* Implement a Node.js CLI tool for OpenADR 3

Redesign the openadr-3-ts-types project into openadr-3-types, structuring it to support type generation in all languages.

Design this project to support generating clients and CLI tools in other languages.
